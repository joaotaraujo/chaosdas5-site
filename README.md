# Chaos das 5 - javascript/HTML - WebSite

About
-----
The Chaos das 5 is an audiovisual digital performance developed by the Transdisciplinary research Group (GTRANS) from the Federal University of  São João del-Rei involving the ALICE (Arts Lab in Interfaces, Computers and Else) / Orchidea (Orchestra of Ideas) group from the Computer Science Department and the ECOLAB / Movère group from the Scenic Arts Department.

The guideline of the performance took Alice, from Lewis Carroll book - Alice in the Wonderland, as a metaphor to take audience to a synthetic and disruptive wonder world.
The audience members could take part of the show and there was no stage or another mark to limit the space of the performers and the audience.

This work is the website of this performance, implemented in javascript/html.
